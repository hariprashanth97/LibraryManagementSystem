# Library API

A Spring Boot RESTful API to manage library borrowers and books, supporting book borrowing and returning operations with validation and concurrency control.

---

## Features

- Register and manage borrowers with unique email addresses.
- Manage books identified by ISBN, with validation rules to ensure data consistency.
- Borrow and return books with business rules enforcement.
- Supports multiple copies of books with the same ISBN.
- Uses optimistic locking to prevent concurrent update conflicts.
- Custom exceptions to handle conflicts and resource not found cases.

## Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- H2 in-memory database (default; can be replaced)
- Lombok for boilerplate code reduction
- Jakarta Validation API
- JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing

## Business Rules

- **ISBN Uniqueness:**
    - Multiple copies with the same ISBN allowed if they have the **same title and author**.
    - If a new book has an existing ISBN but different title or author, the system throws a `DuplicateIsbnException`.

- **Borrowing Books:**
    - A book can only be borrowed if itâ€™s not currently borrowed by someone else.
    - Attempting to borrow an already borrowed book throws a `BookAlreadyBorrowedException`.
    - Concurrent borrow operations are managed using optimistic locking.

- **Returning Books:**
    - Only the borrower who borrowed the book can return it.
    - Returning a book not currently borrowed throws a `BookAlreadyReturnedException`.
